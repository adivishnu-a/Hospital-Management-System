# Hospital Management System
My work for CSE Mini Project in Sem-1

The main objective of the Hospital Management system is to manage details of 
hospital, doctor, employee, test, medicine. The project is totally built at the 
administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access. 
The purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce manual work 
by simplifying the workflow and eliminating long data entry and data organisation.
This can greatly enhance the experience of both patients and the hospital 
administration.
